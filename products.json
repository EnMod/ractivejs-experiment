    "description": "Most famous of the Belmonts, Simon was a man of few words and even less tolerance of the night.  Not only did he storm the vampire's castle by himself and take down Dracula one-on-one, but he also trekked across Wallachia years later to gather Dracula's scattered remains, bringing him back to life. Why? So he could beat Dracula AGAIN...and eliminate the vampire's lingering curse at the same time.",

    "description": "Trevor Belmont was labeled a misfit by Wallachia's citizens along with the rest of the Belmont clan, due to rumors of witchcraft and malevolent supernatural forces they didn't comprehend. That didn't stop Trevor from teaming up with Dracula's son Alucard, a reclusive witch named Sypha Belnades, and a thief named Grant Danasty to take down the Lord of Darkness.  Three years later Trevor assisted Dracula's former Devil Forgemaster, Hector, in freeing Wallachia of Dracula and his curse, as the latter had lingered and given life to the former one last time.",

    "description": "Leon Belmont and Mathias Cronqvist were elite knights of the church...until Mathias lost his wife Elisabetha to disease.  Enraged, Mathias deceived Leon and siezed the powers of vampire Walter Bernhard (and his castle, no less) to rebel against God for taking his wife, becoming the notorious Dracula. Leon had no choice but to create the Vampire Killer - from his Whip of Alchemy and the soul of his betrothed, Sara - to gain strength that would harm Dracula and his servants. Leon swore that from that point on the Belmont clan would \"hunt [Dracula], AND the night!\"",
