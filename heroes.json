Not only did he storm Dracula's castle by himself and take down the vampire's one-on-one, but he also trekked across Wallachia years later to gather Dracula's scattered remains, bringing him back to life. Why? So he could beat Dracula AGAIN...and eliminate the vampire's lingering curse at the same time.",

That didn't stop Trevor from teaming up with Dracula's son Alucard, a reclusive witch named Sypha Belnades, and a thief named Grant Danasty to take down the Lord of Darkness.  Three years later Trevor assisted Dracula's former Devil Forgemaster, Hector, in freeing Wallachia of Dracula and his curse, as the curse had lingered and given life to the fiend once more.",

Enraged, Mathias deceived Leon and siezed the powers of vampire Walter Bernhard (and his castle, no less) to rebel against God for taking his wife, becoming the notorious Dracula. Leon had no choice but to create the Vampire Killer - from his Whip of Alchemy and the soul of his betrothed, Sara - to gain strength that would harm Dracula and his servants. Leon swore that from that point on the Belmont clan would \"hunt [Dracula], AND the night!\"",

In fact, Christopher laid such a beating on Dracula that he was reduced to an escaping cloud of mist!  15 years later, Christopher's son Soleiyu finished his rite of passage into manhood, and all seemed well.  However, a still-weakened Dracula took the boy to his castle! Christopher had to fight through four elemental castles to raise Dracula's from the depths, rescue his son, and finish what he started 15 years prior.",

In 2035 and 2036 Alucard was challenged by what seemed to be his final adversaries: forces hellbent on making the reincarnation of Dracula (Soma Cruz) become a vessel for his resurrection, after the fiend was finally obliterated by Julius Belmont in the Battle of 1999.  Alucard, Julius, Soma, and Sypha Belnades's descendant Yoko thwarted both plans as they unfurled.",

Wielding nothing but her dominion over animals and guardian spirits, Maria fought the darkness but was eventually captured.  Richter Belmont rescued her once he slayed Dracula in 1792. Five years later Richter disappeared, prompting Maria to seek him out.  She found him in Dracula's revived castle, deluded by a dark spell and in combat with Alucard.  Maria developed a strong attraction to Alucard and, following Dracula's defeat at Alucard's hand, convinced him to let her move in.  Good that she did, as he defended her from a devious incubus in the following year.",

The vampire's castle was sealed by Julius in a solar eclipse along with the Vampire Killer, an act which erased many of Julius's memories.  In 2035 Julius's memories were awakened once again after he, along with Alucard, needed to venture into the eclipse and help prevent Dracula's reincarnation Soma Cruz from becoming Dracula himself.  A cult rose to power in the following year, with the goal of bringing forth Dracula's power and using Soma as its vessel; Julius, Alucard, and Sypha Belnades's descendant Yoko assisted Soma in thwarting the cult's plans. One year later, Julius and his constituents rose to the challenge of defeating Olrox, one of Dracula's old generals and mastermind of a siniter plan to conquer the living and chaos realms.",
